**I'm currently documenting everything in a simple HTML table**
 If you can provide me with all of the following information I will add the device to the list :

<table class="table">
<tr>
      <td>First Class Category</td>
      <td>Manufacturers name</td>
      <td>The model for device (if applicable)</td>
      <td>Category of device</td>
      <td>Device category code</td>
      <td>Link(s) to where you can get the product/</td>
      <td> Short description of the product</td>
      <td>A link to an image of the product</td>
    </tr>
</table>

**You can find information like the Device Category and Category code at :**

## About This Project
**What is this Project ?**
<p>It's just a place to capture PBT product that are working with Tuya-v2 and Home Assistant to help user check if their devices are compatible, and also to help with buying new devices. The idea is to just list all Tuya devices that are currently working with the v2 integration and Home Assistant.</p>
</br>

**What it isn't**
<p>It's not a place to report issues with devices. If you have a PBT device that's not working or isn't yet compatible, you should open an issue on the Official Tuya-v2 GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/tuya/tuya-home-assistant" target="_blank">here</a></p>
</br>

**Why is it on GitHub?**
<p>I'm currently working on my New Website which I will port this all over too in the future. But for now Git will work well for just simply displaying a list of different products, and allowing users to contribute to the list. When my site is ready I will link to it on this project.</p>
</br>

**Is this supported by Tuya?**
<p>I have been speaking to Tuya about creating something like this. Initially a <a href="https://github.com/tuya/tuya-home-assistant/discussions/309" target="_blank">Discussion</a> was created on the official Tuya-v2 Git, but it didn't really take off. I suggested a page sort of like this, and Tuya was happy for me to create this and they would direct to it.</p>
</br>

**DISCLAIMER**
<p>I am not associated with Home Assistant or Tuya, and do not own or maintain any of therir hardware, software or other resources.</p>
